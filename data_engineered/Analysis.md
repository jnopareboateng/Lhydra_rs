## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated hybrid music recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering with content-based features. The system leverages deep learning techniques to provide personalized music recommendations based on user listening history, music metadata, and acoustic features.

### Key Features
- Hybrid neural network architecture
- Multi-modal feature processing
- Cold-start handling
- Scalable recommendation generation
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Data Engineering

### Data Preprocessing
The system employs several sophisticated data preprocessing techniques:

```python
# Example of feature normalization
numerical_features = [
    'danceability', 'energy', 'loudness', 'speechiness',
    'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'valence', 'tempo'
]
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_features])
```

### Feature Engineering
1. **Categorical Encoding**
   - User IDs → Dense embeddings
   - Music IDs → Dense embeddings
   - Artist IDs → Dense embeddings
   - Genres → Multi-hot encoding

2. **Numerical Features**
   - Audio features normalization
   - Temporal feature extraction
   - Interaction strength calculation

3. **Text Processing**
   - Genre tokenization
   - Artist name normalization
   - Music title cleaning

## Model Architecture

The `HybridMusicRecommender` class is a sophisticated neural network model designed to handle various types of input features. Here's a breakdown of its architecture:

1. **Embedding Layers**: These layers transform categorical variables into dense vector representations. The model includes embeddings for users, music tracks, artists, and genres. This allows the model to capture latent features from these categories.

   ```python
   self.user_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_users, embedding_dim)
   self.music_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_music, embedding_dim)
   self.artist_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_artists, embedding_dim)
   self.genre_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_genres, embedding_dim)
   ```

2. **Feature Processing Layers**: Numerical and binary features are processed through separate layers, which include linear transformations followed by ReLU activations and batch normalization. This helps in stabilizing the learning process and improving convergence.

   ```python
   self.numerical_layer = nn.Sequential(
       nn.Linear(num_numerical, embedding_dim),
       nn.ReLU(),
       nn.BatchNorm1d(embedding_dim)
   )
   self.binary_layer = nn.Sequential(
       nn.Linear(2, embedding_dim),
       nn.ReLU(),
       nn.BatchNorm1d(embedding_dim)
   )
   ```

3. **MLP Layers with Residual Connections**: The model employs multiple fully connected layers with residual connections, which help in training deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

   ```python
   for layer_size in layers:
       self.fc_layers.append(nn.ModuleDict({
           'main': nn.Sequential(
               nn.Linear(input_dim, layer_size),
               nn.ReLU(),
               nn.BatchNorm1d(layer_size),
               nn.Dropout(dropout)
           ),
           'residual': nn.Linear(input_dim, layer_size) if input_dim != layer_size else None
       }))
   ```

4. **Final Layer**: The output layer is a single neuron that predicts the target variable, which in this case is the play count of a music track.

   ```python
   self.final_layer = nn.Linear(layers[-1], 1)
   ```

## Training Methodology

### Training Configuration
```python
config = {
    'embedding_dim': 64,
    'hidden_layers': [256, 128, 64],
    'dropout': 0.2,
    'learning_rate': 0.001,
    'weight_decay': 1e-5,
    'batch_size': 256,
    'early_stopping_patience': 10,
    'max_grad_norm': 1.0
}
```

### Training Process
1. **Optimizer and Scheduler**
   ```python
   # Adam optimizer with weight decay
   optimizer = optim.Adam(
       model.parameters(),
       lr=config['learning_rate'],
       weight_decay=config['weight_decay']
   )
   
   # Learning rate scheduler
   scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(
       optimizer, mode='min', patience=5, factor=0.5
   )
   ```

2. **Training Loop**
   ```python
   def train_epoch(self):
       self.model.train()
       total_loss = 0
       predictions, targets = [], []
       
       for batch in self.train_loader:
           # Move batch to device
           batch = {k: v.to(self.device) for k, v in batch.items()}
           
           # Forward pass
           pred = self.model(batch)
           loss = self.criterion(pred, batch['plays'])
           
           # Backward pass
           self.optimizer.zero_grad()
           loss.backward()
           torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.model.parameters(), 
                                        self.max_grad_norm)
           self.optimizer.step()
   ```

## Evaluation Metrics

### Metrics Calculation
```python
def calculate_metrics(self, predictions: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor):
    predictions = predictions.cpu().numpy()
    targets = targets.cpu().numpy()
    
    return {
        'rmse': np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(targets, predictions)),
        'mae': mean_absolute_error(targets, predictions),
        'ndcg': calculate_ndcg(predictions, targets)
    }
```

### Performance Analysis
1. **Basic Metrics**
   - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)

2. **Advanced Analysis**
   ```python
   def analyze_cold_start(self, user_interactions):
       # Analyze performance for different user interaction levels
       cold_start = user_interactions < 5
       warm_start = user_interactions >= 5
       
       metrics = {
           'cold_start': calculate_metrics(predictions[cold_start], 
                                        targets[cold_start]),
           'warm_start': calculate_metrics(predictions[warm_start], 
                                        targets[warm_start])
       }
   ```

## Data Handling and Preprocessing

- **Data Splitting and Encoding**: The use of consistent encoding across train and test datasets ensures that the model is trained and evaluated on uniformly processed data, reducing the risk of data leakage or inconsistencies.

## Model Training and Optimization

- **Gradient Clipping and Early Stopping**: These techniques are employed to prevent overfitting and ensure stable training. Gradient clipping helps in managing exploding gradients, while early stopping halts training when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving.

## Model Evaluation and Analysis

- **Cold Start Analysis**: Evaluating model performance on new users or items helps in understanding and mitigating the cold start problem, which is a common challenge in recommendation systems.

## Recommendation Generation

### Generation Process
```python
def generate_recommendations(self, user_id, n_recommendations=10):
    # Prepare user input
    user_tensor = torch.tensor([user_id], device=self.device)
    user_embed = self.user_embedding(user_tensor)
    
    # Generate scores for all items
    all_items = torch.arange(self.num_items, device=self.device)
    scores = self.forward_recommendation(user_embed, all_items)
    
    # Get top-K recommendations
    top_k_scores, top_k_items = torch.topk(scores, k=n_recommendations)
    return top_k_items.cpu().numpy(), top_k_scores.cpu().numpy()
```

### Post-processing
1. **Diversity Enhancement**
   ```python
   def enhance_diversity(recommendations, similarity_matrix, 
                        lambda_div=0.5):
       scores = recommendations['scores']
       items = recommendations['items']
       
       # Calculate diversity penalty
       diversity_penalty = calculate_diversity_penalty(
           items, similarity_matrix
       )
       
       # Adjust scores
       final_scores = scores - lambda_div * diversity_penalty
   ```

2. **Business Rules**
   - Explicit content filtering
   - Genre balancing
   - Popularity consideration

## Recommendation Post-processing

- **Diversity and Business Rules**: Enhancing recommendation diversity and applying business rules (e.g., explicit content filtering, genre balancing) ensure that the recommendations are not only accurate but also aligned with user preferences and business goals.
